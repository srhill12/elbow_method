# README elbow_method

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customer shopping data. We will explore and analyze the data to find optimal customer segments and visualize these segments using scatter plots.

##Steps and Code Explanation
# Initial Imports
First, we import the necessary libraries:

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for plotting, optional but recommended)

# Loading Scaled Customer Shopping Data into Pandas
We load the customer shopping data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame:

# Encoding the "Method" Column
We encode the "Method" column to convert categorical data into numerical data using a helper function:

# Implementing the Elbow Method
We use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means:

1. Create an empty list to store inertia values.
2. Create a list of k-values to try.
3. Use a loop to compute inertia for each k and store it in the list.
4. Create a DataFrame with the k-values and inertia to plot the Elbow curve.
5. Determine the rate of decrease between each k-value to find the elbow point.

# Defining and Fitting the KMeans Model
We define the K-means model with 4 clusters (based on the Elbow Method) and fit the model

# Adding the Clusters to the DataFrame
We add the predicted customer segments to the original DataFrame 

# Visualizing the Customer Segments
We create a scatter plot to visualize the customer segments:

# Summary of Findings
The Elbow Method suggested that 4 clusters provide an optimal segmentation of the customer data. Visualizing these clusters helps in understanding different customer segments based on their shopping patterns.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to apply K-means clustering to segment customers based on their shopping behavior. The Elbow Method helps in determining the optimal number of clusters, and visualizations aid in understanding the customer segments better.
